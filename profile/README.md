# Welcome to `The Enlight Lab`

The Enlight Lab happened when young social enthusiasts came together, integrated their scattered efforts and made it into organization! The team members were social influencers and vocal on various platforms, taking up social issues in their own capacities on counter-radicalization, social inclusion, civic literacy, socio-economic and political injustices. We thought we could make more out of our efforts if put together, that’s how we teamed up to The Enlight Lab.

---
# `Mission`
* To facilitate local communities’ participation and intergenerational partnership in political decision-making.

# `Vision`
* We envision a society where individual coexistence is guaranteed irrespective of their gender, class, religion, and ethnicity.
